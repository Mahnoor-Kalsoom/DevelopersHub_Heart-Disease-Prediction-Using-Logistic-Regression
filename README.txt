# Heart Disease Prediction Using Logistic Regression

## Description
This project focuses on predicting heart disease using the **Heart dataset** and **logistic regression**. The workflow includes data preprocessing, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, model training, and evaluation. Performance is assessed using accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curve, and feature importance analysis.

## Features
- Load and preprocess data (handle missing values, drop irrelevant columns)
- Encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Scale features using StandardScaler
- Train a Logistic Regression model
- Evaluate model performance with:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report
  - ROC Curve and AUC
- Analyze feature importance

## Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.x
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
